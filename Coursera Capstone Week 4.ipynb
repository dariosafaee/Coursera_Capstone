    "The cinema industry has been incredibly resilient for more than a century, and according to the Financial Times, in 2019, global cinema box office reached a new high of over $42bn. Over the last decades, the global industry sales have steadily increased. However, the main driver of this is likely the steady increase in ticket prices, rather than an increase in attendance. In fact, if we look at the US, the number of tickets purchased in 2019 was roughly 1.26 billion, which is the lowest attendance since 2011. It is however worth considering that while attendace is dropping in North America, the numbers overseas continue to rise, especially in Asia. In addition, certain experiences such as those provided by IMAX, cannot be recreated at home. "

In order to find the best location, we'll look at the areas with the lowest concentration of cinemas but a high concentration of what we can define as \"complementary\" venues. These are places that are generally visited in conjunction with movie theathers.\n",
